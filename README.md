# Fire Emblem Heroes Wiki Bot
This repository hosts various Python3 scripts use to create and update pages on the [Fire Emblem Heroes Wiki](https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/).

## Utilisation
### Dependencies
The following dependencies are needed in order to the scripts to work properly:
- [feh-assets-json](https://github.com/HertzDevil/feh-assets-json): HertzDevil repository containing converted version of the Fire Emblem Heroes binaries into JSON objects. This repository will be use whenever possible, and is assumed to always be up-to-date.
- [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install/#install): A module use to perform HTTP requests. Needed in order to create or alter pages, or use the Fire Emblem Heroes Wiki API.
- [num2words](https://pypi.org/project/num2words/): A module use to convert a number into a string. Mainly use on page creation.
- PIL or Pillow: A module use to manipulate image. Needed for everything image related.

The next dependencies are only use by the Reverse part:
- [feh-bin](https://rubygems.org/gems/feh-bin/versions/0.1.0): A [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) module use to compress and decompress FeH binaries (format `.bin.lz`).
- [pycrypto](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/): A module use to decrypt reward informations, as those are encrypted using an AES in Counter mode.
Depending what is your intent using this repository, all dependencies may not be necessaries.

### Personal Data
A `PersonalData.py` module must also be created. This module is use to get some of the needed informations, such as the location of the Fire Emblem Heroes files, or the user who will be use to perform posts.

For sensitiv information, such as password, it is recommand to store them on your environnement, and get them with `os.environ`.

This module must define the following global variable:
- `USER`: The Gamepedia/Fandom user name
- `BOT`: The name of the bot. One can be created [here](https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/Special:BotPasswords)
- `PASSWD`: The password of the bot.
- `JSON_ASSETS_DIR_PATH`: The absolute path to the [feh-assets-json](https://github.com/HertzDevil/feh-assets-json)/files/assets folder on your device.
- `BINLZ_ASSETS_DIR_PATH`: The absolute path to the assets folder containing the unaltered binaries of the Fire Emblem Heroes assets on your device. You can follow the instructions on [this page](https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/Fire_Emblem_Heroes_Wiki:Extracting_game_assets) in order to get these.

You can also define the following variables, despite these being currently unused:
- `WEBP_ASSETS_DIR_PATH`: The absolute path to the assets folder containing the unaltered files of the Fire Emblem Heroes assets on your device. If you extract data yourselves, it will be the same as `BINLZ_ASSETS_DIR_PATH`.
- `APK_ASSETS_DIR_PATH`: The absolute path to the assets folder of the Fire Emblem Heroes APK on your device. You can follow the same steps as above to get them, while navigating to folder `app` instead of `data`.
